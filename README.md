# vmtk4aneurysms #

### What is this repository for? ###

vmtk4aneurysms provides [VMTK](http://www.vmtk.org/)-like scripts to manipulate
and morphologically characterize vascular models with saccular aneurysms. It
also accounts with modules providing representations for vascular geometries
harboring intracranial aneurysms. It can be used to compute and manipulate
fields defined on surfaces, mainly hemodynamics and wall motion fields
related to fluid-solid interaction simulations with vascular models.

### How do I get set up? ###

Just make sure to have the Vascular Modeling Toolkit (VMTK) installed, as
suggested in the official website. It also depends on the
[MorphMan](https://github.com/KVSlab/morphMan) library for some surface
manipulations Python libraries such as SciPy, NumPy, and Pandas.
